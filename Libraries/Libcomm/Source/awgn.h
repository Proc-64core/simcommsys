 \brief   Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel.

 \version 1.10 (15 Apr 1999)
 Changed the definition of set_snr to avoid using the pow() function.
 This was causing an unexplained SEGV with optimised code

 \version 1.11 (6 Mar 2002)
 changed vcs version variable from a global to a static class variable.

 \version 1.20 (13 Mar 2002)
 updated the system to conform with the completed serialization protocol (in conformance
 with channel 1.10), by adding the necessary name() function, and also by adding a static
 serializer member and initialize it with this class's name and the static constructor
 (adding that too). Also made the channel object a public base class, rather than a
 virtual public one, since this was affecting the transfer of virtual functions within
 the class (causing access violations). Also moved most functions into the implementation
 file rather than here.

 \version 1.30 (27 Mar 2002)
 changed descriptive output function to conform with channel 1.30.

 \version 1.40 (30 Oct 2006)
 - defined class and associated data within "libcomm" namespace.

 \version 1.50 (16 Oct 2007)
 changed class to conform with channel 1.50.

 \version 1.51 (16 Oct 2007)
 changed class to conform with channel 1.51.

 \version 1.52 (17 Oct 2007)
 changed class to conform with channel 1.52.

 \version 1.53 (29 Oct 2007)
 - updated clone() to return this object's type, rather than its base class type. [cf. Stroustrup 15.6.2]

 \version 1.54 (24 Jan 2008)
 - Changed derivation from channel to channel<sigspace>
