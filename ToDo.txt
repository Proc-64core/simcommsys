Tasks identified to be done, in order of decreasing priority. We divide this
into two sections: the first is restricted to development concerns only, while
the second involves new features (ie tasks that reach a research objective).
It is good to annotate these by how important they are:
- Urgent: fixes for bugs causing problems with plain build
- Important: fixes for bugs causing problems with other builds
The above two refer to problems that cause broken builds or erroneous results,
and should be done before a merge to trunk.
- High: high-priority tasks that do not cause broken builds or erroneous results

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Implement local caching of fba2 in fba2-cuda [High]
  (needed to support CUDA sims where gamma table does not fit in memory)
* Refactor codec_softout_mapped and codec_reshaped to take base class by
  serialization rather than as a template parameter
* Remove mapper class from commsys objects; replace functionality with the
  use of codec_softout_mapped

Feature Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Add facility for puncturing/padding at the mapper interface
* Plot posterior PDF at given boundary locations
* Generalize BPMR model to work with TVB [shelve for now]
* Implement BPMR receiver side [shelve for now]
* Implement simulator to capture boundary pdf entropy [shelve for now]
* Implement simulator to capture symbol pdf entropy [shelve for now]
