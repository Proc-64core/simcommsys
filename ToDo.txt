Tasks identified to be done, in order of decreasing priority. We divide this
into two sections: the first is restricted to development concerns only, while
the second involves new features (ie tasks that reach a research objective).
It is good to annotate these by how important they are:
- Urgent: fixes for bugs causing problems with plain build
- Important: fixes for bugs causing problems with other builds
The above two refer to problems that cause broken builds or erronous results,
and should be done before a merge to trunk.
- High: high-priority tasks that do not cause broken builds or erronous results

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~
* Implement local caching of fba2 in fba2-cuda [High]
  (needed to support CUDA sims where gamma table does not fit in memory)
* Implement CUDA port of tvb

Feature Requests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Change simulator stopping criterion to include absolute error (beside %age)
* Implement full-system iteration with streaming
* Generalize BPMR model to work with TVB [shelve for now]
* Implement BPMR receiver side [shelve for now]
* Implement simulator to capture boundary pdf entropy [shelve for now]
* Implement simulator to capture symbol pdf entropy [shelve for now]
