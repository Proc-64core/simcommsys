# SimCommSys

The SimCommSys project consists of a set of C++ libraries for simulating
communication systems using a distributed Monte Carlo simulator.
Of principal interest is the error-control coding component, where various
kinds of binary and non-binary codes are implemented, including turbo, LDPC,
repeat-accumulate, and Reed-Solomon.
This project also contains a number of executables implementing various
stages of the communication system (such as the encoder, decoder, and a
complete simulator) and a system benchmark.
Finally, a number of shell and python scripts are provided to encapsulate
routine use cases.

Documentation is available as follows:
- User documentation can be found in the Wiki. This includes instructions for:
  - Building and installing the executables
  - Setting up and running simulations
  - Collecting and plotting results
- Technical documentation is divided as follows:
  - High level technical documentation can be found in the Wiki. This includes:
    - An overview of the SimCommSys framework
    - An example extension of the framework (adding a new codec)
  - Detailed documentation for the API can be built from the code:
    1. Build the doxygen documentation using 'make doc'
    2. Start with the main page: doc/html/index.html
